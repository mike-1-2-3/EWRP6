* An idle, desktop, minimal graphics, strategy game. Currently in the demo phase. *

##Requirements to run binary
* SDL 1.2 and SDL image
* A semi-recent linux (briefly tested on Debian Sid and Ubuntu 14.04, other distributions will likely need to put libSDL.so, etc., where the binary can find it, until the release is packaged better)

##Requirements to run source
* Same as above, in addition:
* Only tested in SBCL
* quicklisp, lispbuilder-sdl, lispbuilder-sdl-image, and cl-load
